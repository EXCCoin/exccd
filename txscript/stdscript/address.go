// not blindly assume the slice will be of a particular length for a given
// returned script type and should always check the length prior to access in
// case the addresses were not able to be created.
//
// NOTE: Version 0 scripts are the only currently supported version.  It will
// always return a nonstandard script type and no addresses for other script
// versions.
