## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Exchangecoin doesnt run a bug bounty but will take every single report seriously. None of the report, if reproducible and confirmed, will be left unpaid.

Please contact support@excc.co with any kind of reports.

## Supported Versions

All bugs must be reproducible in the latest production release or the master branch of the code.
