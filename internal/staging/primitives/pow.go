// DiffBitsToUint256 converts the compact representation used to encode
// difficulty targets to an unsigned 256-bit integer.  The representation is
// similar to IEEE754 floating point numbers.
//
// Like IEEE754 floating point, there are three basic components: the sign,
// the exponent, and the mantissa.  They are broken out as follows:
//
//   - the most significant 8 bits represent the unsigned base 256 exponent
//
//   - bit 23 (the 24th bit) represents the sign bit
//
//   - the least significant 23 bits represent the mantissa
//
//     -------------------------------------------------
//     |   Exponent     |    Sign    |    Mantissa     |
//     -------------------------------------------------
//     | 8 bits [31-24] | 1 bit [23] | 23 bits [22-00] |
//     -------------------------------------------------
//
// The formula to calculate N is:
//
//	N = (-1^sign) * mantissa * 256^(exponent-3)
//
// Note that this encoding is capable of representing negative numbers as well
// as numbers much larger than the maximum value of an unsigned 256-bit integer.
// However, it is only used in Decred to encode unsigned 256-bit integers which
// represent difficulty targets, so rather than using a much less efficient
// arbitrary precision big integer, this implementation uses an unsigned 256-bit
// integer and returns flags to indicate whether or not the encoding was for a
// negative value and/or overflows a uint256 to enable proper error detection
// and stay consistent with legacy code.
func DiffBitsToUint256(bits uint32) (n uint256.Uint256, isNegative bool, overflows bool) {
	// Extract the mantissa, sign bit, and exponent.
	mantissa := bits & 0x007fffff

	// Nothing to do when the mantissa is zero as any multiple of it will
	// necessarily also be 0 and therefore it can never be negative or overflow.
	if mantissa == 0 {
		return n, false, false
	}

	// Since the base for the exponent is 256 = 2^8, the exponent is a multiple
	// of 8 and thus the full 256-bit number is computed by shifting the
	// mantissa right or left accordingly.
	//
	// This and the following section are equivalent to:
	//
	// N = mantissa * 256^(exponent-3)

	// more than 256 bits to represent will overflow.  Also, since the encoded
	// exponent value is decreased by 3 and then multiplied by 8, any encoded
	// exponent of 35 or greater will cause an overflow because 256/8 + 3 = 35.
	// Decreasing the encoded exponent by one to 34 results in making 8 bits
	// available, meaning the max mantissa can be 0xff in that case.  Similarly,
	// decreasing the encoded exponent again to 33 results in making a total of
	// 16 bits available, meaning the max mantissa can be 0xffff in that case.
	// Finally, decreasing the encoded exponent again to 32 results in making a
	// total of 24 bits available and since the mantissa only encodes 23 bits,
	// overflow is impossible for all encoded exponents of 32 or lower.
