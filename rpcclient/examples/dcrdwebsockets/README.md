dcrd Websockets Example
=======================

This example shows how to use the rpcclient package to connect to a exccd RPC
server using TLS-secured websockets, register for block connected and block
disconnected notifications, and get the current block count.

This example also sets a timer to shutdown the client after 10 seconds to
demonstrate clean shutdown.

## Running the Example

After obtaining the source code, modify the `main.go` source to specify the
correct RPC username and password for the RPC server:

```Go
	User: "yourrpcuser",
	Pass: "yourrpcpass",
```

Then, navigate to the example's directory and run it with:

```bash
$ go run *.go
```
