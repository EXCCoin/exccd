## Fixed Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integer Arithmetic

This package implements highly optimized allocation free fixed precision
unsigned 256-bit integer arithmetic.

The following is a brief overview of the main features and benefits:

- Strong focus on performance and correctness
  - Every operation is faster than the stdlib `big.Int` equivalent and most
    operations, including the primary math operations, are **significantly** faster
    ([see performance comparison benchmarks](#uint256-performance-comparison))
- Allocation free
  - All non-formatting operations with the specialized type are allocation free
- Supports boolean comparison, bitwise logic, and bitwise shift operations
- All operations are performed modulo 2^256
- Ergonomic API with unary-style arguments as well as some binary variants
    - eg: `n.SetUint64(1).Lsh(64).SubUint64(1)` is equivalent to `n = 1<<64 - 1`
    - eg: `n.Div2(n1, n2)` is equivalent to `n = n1/n2`
- Conversion-free support for interoperation with native `uint64` integers
- Direct conversion to and from little and big endian byte arrays
- Full support for formatted output and common base conversions
  - Producing formatted output uses fewer allocations than `big.Int`
- 100% test coverage
- Comprehensive benchmarks

The primary `big.Int` operations that are **NOT** currently provided:

- Modular arithmetic with moduli other than 2^256
- Signed arithmetic
  - A caller could fairly easily implement it with 2's complement if desired
    since `Negate` is provided
- Remainders from division

These operations may be implemented in the future if the need arises.

### Note About Standard Library `math/big.Int` Conversions

This package provides convenience methods for converting to and from standard
library `big.Int`s, however, callers should make an active effort to avoid that
unless it is absolutely necessary as conversion to `big.Int` requires an
unavoidable allocation in most circumstances and `big.Int` is also slower for
every operation, often to a significant degree.  Further, `big.Int`s often cause
further allocations while performing arithmetic, notably multiplication and
division.

Regarding the aforementioned allocations, standard library `big.Int`s internally
require heap allocations to operate, so conversion to a new `big.Int`
necessarily causes an allocation.  This means the `ToBig` method will always
incur at least one allocation.

One feature of `big.Int`s is that they attempt to reuse their internal buffer
when possible, so the number of allocations due to conversion can sometimes be
reduced if reusing the same variable is an option.  This package provides a
`PutBig` method which allows callers to reuse an existing `big.Int` for this
purpose.

Do note however that even when reusing a `big.Int`, it will naturally still
require an allocation for the internal buffer unless it has already previously
allocated one large enough to be reused.
